            <h2>Zodiac Killer Discovered?</h2>
            <p>
                Recent news of the Zodiac Killer’s identity being discovered has broke out. 
                It has been reported by Fox news that his name is Gary F. Poste. This 
                conclusion was reached by a group of people called the Case Breakers who 
                determined that he was the Zodiac Killer by evidence and photos found in 
                Poste’s dark room. In these photographs, it was revealed that he had a scar 
                on his forehead that matched the sketch of the Zodiac Killer. This evidence 
                dubious however. Attempts have been made to connect to other cases such as 
                the Bates Case, but it was concluded that they were not connected. The 
                Authorities have rebuffed the Case Breakers and have stated that their 
                evidence is mostly circumstantial. The waters are murky but it seems likely 
                at a real conclusion to this case will not come soon.

            <h2>Gabby Petito Update</h2>
            <p>
                The Gabby Petito case has gained a lot of traction in world of social media. 
                Since her disappearance in August 2021, where she was last seen with her boyfriend. 
                People have been following the case closely and demanding justice for her. Following 
                her disappearance there have been major search parties to find her boyfriend and 
                to search for her. Consequently, many other missing persons cases have been solved, 
                and the remains of victims have been recovered. The solving of these cases has garnered 
                new awareness for missing persons and domestic abuse. In a recently released bodycam 
                video from a Utah police officer, it was revealed that Gabby Petito was exhibiting 
                signs of abuse from her boyfriend Brian Laundrie. As a result, of this footage and 
                the Petito case, the public has become more educated on domestic abuse. There have 
                been videos made about how to handle domestic abuse or how to signal for help if you 
                find yourself in these situations. With the recovery of the bodies it just goes to show 
                that people do give on missing person cases if they do not strike the hearts of the masses.
