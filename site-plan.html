        <h2>Zodiac Killer Found?</h2>
        <p>
          Recent news of the Zodiac Killer’s identity being discovered has broke out. It has been 
          reported by Fox news that his name is Gary F. Poste. This conclusion was reached by a group 
          of people called the Case Breakers who determined that he was the Zodiac Killer by evidence 
          and photos found in Poste’s dark room. In these photographs, it was revealed that he had a 
          scar on his forehead that matched the sketch of the Zodiac Killer. This evidence dubious however. 
          Attempts have been made to connect to other cases such as the Bates Case, but it was concluded 
          that they were not connected. The Authorities have rebuffed the Case Breakers and have stated 
          that their evidence is mostly circumstantial. The waters are murky but it seems likely at a real 
          conclusion to this case will not come soon.

          disappearance in August 2021, where she was last seen with her boyfriend. People have been 
          following the case closely and demanding justice for her. Following her disappearance there 
          have been major search parties to find her boyfriend and to search for her. Consequently, many 
          other missing persons cases have been solved, and the remains of victims have been recovered. The 
          solving of these cases has garnered new awareness for missing persons and domestic abuse. In a recently 
          released bodycam video from a Utah police officer, it was revealed that Gabby Petito was exhibiting 
          signs of abuse from her boyfriend Brian Laundrie. As a result, of this footage and the Petito case, 
          the public has become more educated on domestic abuse. There have been videos made about how to handle 
          domestic abuse or how to signal for help if you find yourself in these situations. With the recovery 
          of the bodies it just goes to show that people do give on missing person cases if they do not strike 
          the hearts of the masses.
